[![crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/udp-stream.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/udp-stream)


`udp-stream` is a Rust library that provides a simple API for handling streaming data over the User Datagram Protocol (UDP), similar to TcpStream. It abstracts the complexities of working with UDP, such as handling packet fragmentation, reassembly, and flow control, making it easy for developers to send and receive continuous streams of data over UDP sockets especially when using DTLS protocol.

## Features

-   **Stream-based**: `udp-stream` provides an abstraction layer for handling UDP packets as a continuous stream of data, using a similar function signature as `TcpStream` in the `tokio` library. This allows developers familiar with `tokio` to leverage their existing knowledge to work with UDP in a similar manner.
    
-   **Lightweight**: `udp-stream` has a small footprint and only depends on the `tokio` and `bytes` libraries, making it lightweight and easy to integrate into your existing projects.
    
## Usage

To use `udp-stream` in your Rust project, simply add it as a dependency in your `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
[dependencies]
udp-stream = "0.1"
``` 

Then, you can import and use the library in your Rust code:

```rust,no_run
use std::{net::SocketAddr, str::FromStr};
use tokio::io::{AsyncReadExt, AsyncWriteExt};
use udp_stream::UdpStream;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let mut stream = UdpStream::connect(SocketAddr::from_str("127.0.0.1:8080")?).await?;
    println!("Ready to Connected to {}", &stream.peer_addr()?);
    let mut buffer = String::new();
    loop {
        std::io::stdin().read_line(&mut buffer)?;
        stream.write_all(buffer.as_bytes()).await?;
        let mut buf = vec![0u8; 1024];
        let n = stream.read(&mut buf).await?;
        print!("-> {}", String::from_utf8_lossy(&buf[..n]));
        buffer.clear();
    }
}
```
